\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
	We propose \emph{Universal Composability for the Win} (\ucftw), a novel dice game for two or more players. 
	The goal of the game is to obtain the most powerful security notion at the table. 
	As it is often not easily determined if a security notion implies another, the key to winning the game are clever arguments.
	The game proceeds in turns. 
	Each turn, the players throw the dice to obtain a quantifier and a party to complement their notion. 
	Random modifiers spice things up.
	The player with the most powerful security notion wins---with the obvious exception that no notion trumps the Universal Composability (UC)~\cite{can01,can05,can13} notion.
	To the best of our knowledge, \ucftw is the first UC-based game to be proposed.

\section{Introduction}
\begin{theorem}
  If a matter cannot decided by the rules of the game alone, or should any rule be ill-defined, the issue is to be resolved by discussion.
